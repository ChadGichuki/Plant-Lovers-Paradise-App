# PLANT LOVERS PARADISE
This is a web application for use by a gardening store to keep track of plants already on sale and those maturing from the nursery. The app can also be used to keep track of their client list. 

The project consists of 2 parts:
- The Back end (current repository) implemented in Ruby (Sinatra).
- [The Front end](https://github.com/ChadGichuki/plant-lovers-paradise.git) implemented in ReactJS.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites
The following should be installed: Python3, pip, postgresql node

### Setting up the backend
1) Database:
 - Start the postgres server. For Linux users: `sudo service postgresql-9.3 start`
 - Log onto the psql command line tool. Run `sudo -u postgres psql`
 - Create the trivia database by running `createdb trivia`
 - cd into the backend folder and populate the database using the trivia.psql file provided. `psql trivia < trivia.psql`

2) Dependencies
 - Create a virtual environment and activate it. Run:
 ```
 virtualenv venv 
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```
 - cd into the /backend folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
 
3) Flask Server
 - While in the /backend folder, you will need to run the following 2 commands the first time:
 ```
 export FLASK_APP=flaskr
 export FLASK_ENV=development
 ```
 - To start the server, use the command `flask run`
 
 4) Setting up the testing database
 - Run the following commands to set up the test database
 ```
 dropdb trivia_test
 createdb trivia_test
 psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
 ```
 - To run the tests in test_flaskr.py, run `python3 test_flaskr.py`
 
 ### Setting up the frontend
 1) cd into /frontend folder
 2) Run `npm install` to install required packages.
 3) Run `npm start` to run the app
